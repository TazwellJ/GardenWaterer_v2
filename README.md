# Pico_GardenWaterer_v2
Contains MicroPython code for an automated container garden watering system using a Raspberry Pi Pico and Chirp moisture sensors.  Moisture levels and pump activity are uploaded to a [ThingSpeak.com](http://www.thingspeak.com) dashboard for monitoring.

The sensors and relay board use the I2C protocol to communicate so you could expand this up to 100+ devices with appropriate power supply, relay boards and I2C multiplexors.

All materials can be found in the [BOM](https://github.com/TazwellJ/Pico_GardenWaterer_v2/blob/main/BOM.txt) file.
