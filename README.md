# Pico_GardenWaterer_v2
Contains code for an automated container garden watering system using a Raspberry Pi Pico and Chirp moisture sensors.  Moisture levels and pump activity are uploaded to a ThingSpeak.com dashboard for monitoring.

The sensors and relay board use the I2C protocol to communicate so you could expand this up to 100+ devices with appropriate power supply, relay boards and I2C multiplexors.
